According to email on 2014/10/26 06:49PM "COMP3111: Project Phase 1 Reminder and Demo Instructions" :

2. Please don't forget to include a document that explains your >>individual
contribution<< assignment. The >>project webpage<< describes what you need to
specify in detail. Fail to submit this document will lead to a random
check at the discretion of the marking TA.
so, in :

2.Each group member will need to indicate which features of the calendar system that she or he has worked on. The feature must match one of the >>numbered requirements stated in the problem statement<<.

so:
https://course.cse.ust.hk/comp3111/ps.html
1.
Single user environment: At this stage, you may assume that the calendar is used only by a single user to arrange her personal schedule. No other users are present or can view/access the information of the calendar.
2.
Basic event scheduling: The calendar must be able to provide basic scheduling capabilities for an individual user.
The user can schedule an event with the starting time, end time, the event description, the event location, the frequency, if a reminder is needed, how much time ahead the reminder should be triggered, and additional description for the event.
The time specification should be in intervals of 15 minutes. The event frequency can be one-time, daily, weekly, or monthly. Should a reminder be needed, it should be triggered and displayed to the user at or less than the specified time interval before the scheduled time of the event. The reminder should only be given ONCE.
The reminder information, the event location, and the event description can be optionally specified. Other information must be specified. The location must be selected from a list of predefined locations in the system.
The successfully scheduled event should cause GUI to change accordingly. An entry should show in the daily view and the day when the event is scheduled should change color on the month view.
3.
Location information: The location must be uniquely identified by its name. The user must select from a set of predefined locations. The locations can be added through a separate interface (Note that this interface does not exist in the current skeleton).
4.
Event validity: The user can neither schedule multiple events that overlap in time or in space nor an event happens in the past. The user can only modify or delete any events that have not yet happened.
5.
Notification: The calendar system should provide notification services to the user at a user-defined interval prior to the time when the event happens.

So:
